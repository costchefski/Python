Program ideas for MTG Python programs

1. Deck builder helper
- Start with given number of card slots
- Pre-load commander deck  build template (from Command Zone etc)
- Ask for input in each category (card draw, ramp, interaction, deck synergy)
- Allow for double categorising
- Calculate mana curve, including commander
- Advise on amount of lands

2. Card collection builder
- Init camera
- Read text on card
- Compare text with online databases
- Pull text from online database, or read text from card
- Save text to database into categories: card name, card type(s), card mana value, card text
- Based on text / conditions, apply category (card draw, ramp, interaction etc)

3. Deck builder - advanced
- Combine 1 and 2 above
- Ask for commander choice
- determine colors of possible cards
- Preload selection with existing cards in the color
- Preload categories with existing cards in the color
- Possibly scrape EDHREC for existing cards with high synergy
